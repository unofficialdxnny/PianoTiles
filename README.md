You have two files that are needed `pag.py` and `main.py`

- hover over the tile slots which are named `1-4` (left to right) and press enter roughly where the tile should be clicked.
- Add the coordinates to your `main.py` at the end just change the `y-axis` to be the same as oneother.

  - run `main.py` and than start the game from this link https://www.agame.com/game/magic-piano-tiles
  - you may use another piano tiles game with this script.
